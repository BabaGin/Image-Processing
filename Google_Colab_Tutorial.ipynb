It's written in C++ and has interfaces for C++, Python, Java, and MATLAB/Octave, making it widely accessible to developers across different programming languages. Key features include image processing, video analysis, object detection, machine learning integration, computational photography, and camera calibration. OpenCV is widely used across industries like robotics, healthcare, and automotive for its versatility and extensive functionality."

The function remains in a waiting state for the specified duration, anticipating any keyboard event. If a key is pressed within that timeframe, the program proceeds accordingly. Setting the argument to 0 results in an indefinite wait for a keystroke. It can also be configured to recognize specific keystrokes, such as the Q key or the ESC key.\n",
